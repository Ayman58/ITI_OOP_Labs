Day5:
======
1- Re-write Stack Example, with:
	- static int counter
	- static int getCounter()

2- Base/Drived classes:

class Base
	- private members x
	- protected member y
	- constrcutors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- function sum (return summation of x and y)

class Drived
	- private members z
	- constrcutors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- override function sum in derived to add functionality to the base sum function:
	(return summation of x and y and z)
	


3- Class GeoShape:

class Geoshape
	- private members dim1, dim2
	- constrcutors & destructor
	- setters & getters
	- function CalcArea(return 0)	

	- then we have to create 4 derived classes (Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle) 
	in which they inherit from GeoShape base class.
	- override function CalcArea in these derived classes to claculate area according to each shape


Note: Students should Trace the code by F7 or F8 to see the sequence of calling of constructors of Base and Derived.
